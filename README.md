## 🛠 Features

### Dynamic Sections
Instead of hardcoded HTML, sections such as:
- Skills  
- Projects  
- Timeline  

are all generated from simple JavaScript data arrays.  
Add, edit, or remove entries with minimal code changes.

### Easy Maintenance
Only a few data blocks need editing to update content — no hunting through repeated markup.

### Responsive Layout
Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Navigation Highlights
Active section tracking improves usability on scroll.
